## 🧠 **Project Name: Application Developer AI**

### 🔧 **Overview**

**Application Developer AI** is a powerful AI-assisted backend system that allows users to manage entire software development workflows using natural language. Built on **OpenAI’s Custom GPT** + a **Python FastAPI middleman application**, it enables seamless interaction between human intent and automated Git/GitHub operations.

---

## 🎯 **Key Goal**

> To let developers and non-developers alike create, update, and deploy Git-based projects simply by talking to GPT — no terminal, no IDE required.

## 🛠️ **Core Capabilities**

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🗣️ **Natural Language Input** | Users describe what they want via GPT prompts (e.g., “Create a Flask app with login”) |
| 🌐 **Webhook Endpoint** | Custom GPT routes commands to a FastAPI-powered middleman via `/api/webhook` |
| 🧩 **Modular Actions** | Each command is mapped to a function: create repo, clone, generate code, commit, push, PR |
| 📁 **Local Project Management** | GitPython handles repo cloning, commits, branch control, and diff inspection |
| 🔐 **GitHub Integration** | PyGithub handles remote repo creation, pushing, PR creation, and validation |
| 🧠 **AI Code Generation** | GPT can generate or update files and summarize diffs for commit messages |
| ✅ **Swagger Interface** | Test and inspect all functions live through FastAPI’s built-in docs (`/docs`) |

---

## 🔂 **Example Workflow**

> “Use this repo: https://github.com/user/my-api, create a feature/login branch, add a login route, commit, and open a pull request.”
> 

This triggers:

1. Validate & clone repo
2. Create and checkout a new branch
3. GPT generates the route code
4. Save to file → commit → push
5. Open PR via GitHub API
